/**
  * @tparam DomElementTargetEvent
  *            An event that has an Element as `target`.
  *            This event type has no corresponding type in JS DOM. See our own `TypedTargetEvent` trait.
  * @tparam DomHtmlElementTargetEvent
  *            An event that has an HTMLElement as `target`.
  *            This event type has no corresponding type in JS DOM. See our own `TypedTargetEvent` trait.
  * @tparam DomFormElementTargetEvent
  *            An event that has an HTMLFormElement as `target`.
  *            This event type has no corresponding type in JS DOM. See our own `TypedTargetEvent` trait.
  * @tparam DomInputElementTargetEvent
  *            An event that has an HTMLInputElement as `target`.
  *            This event type has no corresponding type in JS DOM. See our own `TypedTargetEvent` trait.
  *            - Strictly speaking, this type is not applicable to `onInput` because the latter
  *              can be fired on any HTMLElement that has `contentEditable` mode enabled.
  *            - Similarly for `onChange` and `onSelect` â€“ these could also fire on an `HTMLTextAreaElement`.
  * @tparam DomInputEvent
  *            DOM InputEvent https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/InputEvent
  *            Note: This type is not implemented in scala-js-dom
